# ML-project
Hello, this is Pushkar!
In this project I have designed machine larning model to classify the given accent dataset into US and non-US accent data. Used dataset from Speaker Accent Recognition 
Data Set- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Speaker+Accent+Recognition.

I have tried to check accuracy using different classifiers like KNN, SVM, logistic regression, LDA and decision tree. Got the best performance using KNN classifier.
Also used different feature extraction and tuning methods like Principle component analysis (PCA), removing outliers for better accuracy.
I have used Jupyter notebook to write code in Python.

Files included here:
1. Project report 
2. code files considering different parameters
3. extra readme file to understand code 
4. dataset file (.csv)

Thank you!
Open for suggestion.
